 ### Objective: 

• Write in a clean file a command line that searches, starting from the current directory and in all its subdirectories, the files whose name ends
with ~, or start and end with #.

• The command line will display and delete found files.

• Only one command is authorized: no ’;’ , ’&&’ or something like that.

```diff
! man find
```
