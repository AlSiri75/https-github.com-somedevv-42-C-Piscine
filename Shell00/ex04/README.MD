|---------------------------------------|
|             midLS                     |
| Turn-in directory : ex04/             |
| Files to turn in : midLS              |
| Allowed functions : None              |

 ### Objective: 

* Write in a midLS file the command line to be executed to list
the files and directories of the current directory, but not the hidden files,
neither "." nor ".." (nothing that starts with a period), separated by commas, ordered by
creation date and in such a way that the directories are followed by the character
slash ("/").
