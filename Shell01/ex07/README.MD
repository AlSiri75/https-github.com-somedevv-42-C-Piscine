## Exercise 07 : r_dwssap

|               Exercise 07             |
|---------------------------------------|
|             r_dwssap.sh               |
| Turn-in directory : ex07/             |
| Files to turn in : r_dwssap.sh        |
| Allowed functions : None              |

 ### Objective: 

• Write a command that displays the output of a cat /etc/passwd, removing the
comments, one out of every two lines starting with the second, reversing each
username and sorting it in reverse alphabetical order, keeping only the
usernames between FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2, both included,
separated by ", " (without quotes) and ending with a ".".

• Example: Between lines 7 and 15, the result will be something like this:

<pre><code>$> ./r_dwssap.sh
sstq_, sorebrek_brk_, soibten_, sergtsop_, scodved_, rlaxcm_, rgmecived_, revreswodniw_, revressta_
     .$></pre></code>

```diff
! Follow the order of the statement strictly.
```
