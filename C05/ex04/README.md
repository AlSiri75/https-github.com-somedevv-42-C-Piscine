 ### Objective: 

• Write a function ft_fibonacci that returns the nth element of the sequence
Fibonacci; the first element of the series is at index 0. We will consider that
the Fibonacci sequence begins with 0, 1, 1, 2.

• Overflows will not have to be managed.

• The prototype of the function should be the following:
```C
int ft_fibonacci(int index);
```
• Of course, ft_fibonacci will have to be recursive.

• If the index is less than 0, the function will return -1.
