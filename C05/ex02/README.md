| Files to turn in : ft_iterative_power.c            |
| Allowed functions : None              |

 ### Objective: 

• Write an iterative function that returns a power of a number. A power less than 0 will return 0.

• It is not necessary to manage the “int overflows”, the return of the function will be undefined.

• We have decided that 0 power 0 will return 1

• The prototype of the function should be the following:
```C
int ft_iterative_power(int nb, int power);
```
