 ### Objective: 

• Write a function ft_div_mod that has the following prototype:
```C
void ft_div_mod(int a, int b, int *div, int *mod);
```

• This function divides the two parameters a and b and stores the result in the int
pointed by div.
It also stores the remainder of the division of a and b in the int pointed to by mod.
